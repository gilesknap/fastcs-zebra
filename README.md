# fastcs_zebra

An EPICS driver for the zebra box

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

PyPI            | `pip install fastcs-zebra`

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from fastcs_zebra import __version__

print(f"Hello fastcs_zebra {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m fastcs_zebra --version
```
